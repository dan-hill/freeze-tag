In the Online Time Dependant Freeze-Tag Problem (OTDFTP) we are given a swarm of hibernating robots and a single awake robot. Our goal is to awaken the entire swarm in the least amount of time possible. Hibernating robots enter sleep mode once they have reached an internal release time. Awake robots can then awaken a sleeping robot by traveling to it's location and touching it. Using the Nearest Neighbor Heuristic to choose awakening targets, we reach a competitive ratio of $\frac{5}{2} - \epsilon$ for any $\epsilon > 0$. We also provide empirical analysis using random geometric datasets.
